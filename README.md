# REACT_Project
A project for EC 500 about Web and App.          
A webpage in React for displaying video about actual UFO.       
An App for playing UFO game in React Native.      

Recently, here is an explosive news about UFO, "Pentagon officially releases UFO videos". Video can be viewed [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW9g_gx2BqM)      
As a team interested in this kind of news, we would like to attract more people to pay attention on this. We created a webpage to show videos about UFO, then when people are interested in UFO, they can scan our QR code to play the game made in React Native. Hope this project will be interesting for people.     

## User Story     
As [b]a fan of alien stuff[/b], I want to know more abut UFO through video(s) since video has a bunch of introductions and images which can help me understand more.    
As [b]a normal person who has no idea about UFO[/b], a brief video will be enough for me and I would be appreciated if I can play a small game on phone which can help me not too nervous.
